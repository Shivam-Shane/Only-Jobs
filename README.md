# Only Jobs

**Only Jobs** is a Django-based web application designed to create a trusted platform for job postings. It allows recruiters to upload authentic job posts while leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) to verify the authenticity of the uploader. Users can browse and view verified job listings with confidence.
